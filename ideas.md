ok lets let the top1 maxdiff that is spawned (the one that makes the most money, based on the avg_return) have a kind of special behaviour where it doesnt check the market pct - so it just opens said order straight away at said entry price - this is so that
  say - thats more likely to yea actually take the place like if we have that order in the market then the other spawned pair (the less profitable maxdiff pairs that are waiting to enter the market which might but)
