offline dataset builder, and the Gymnasium environment so that the
experiment can be tuned from scripts without rewriting logic.

class PortfolioEnvConfig:
    """
    Parameters controlling the trading environment dynamics.

    Attributes:
        costs_bps: Baseline proportional trading cost expressed in basis points.
        per_asset_costs_bps: Optional per-asset overrides; length must match asset universe.
        turnover_penalty: Scalar multiplied with portfolio turnover in the reward.
        drawdown_penalty: Scalar applied to running max drawdown to discourage deep losses.
        cvar_penalty: Scalar applied to predicted CVaR (if supplied by the feature cube).
        uncertainty_penalty: Scalar applied to forecast uncertainty term (e.g., q90 - q10).
        weight_cap: Maximum per-asset allocation for long-only configurations. If None,
            no per-asset cap is enforced beyond feasibility constraints.
        allow_short: Enable long/short allocations with symmetric leverage bounds.
        leverage_cap: Gross leverage cap when allow_short=True. For long-only this is ignored.
        include_cash: If True, a synthetic cash asset is appended with deterministic return.
        cash_return: Deterministic return for the synthetic cash asset per step.
        forecast_cvar_alpha: Alpha level assumed when interpreting CVaR forecast inputs.
        leverage_head: When True, appends a leverage control head to the action vector.
        base_gross_exposure: Gross exposure that is free of financing costs (typically 1Ã—).
        max_gross_leverage: End-of-day gross leverage cap.
        intraday_leverage_cap: Intraday gross leverage cap; enforced immediately after order execution.
        closing_leverage_cap: Optional explicit end-of-day cap. Defaults to ``max_gross_leverage``.
        daily_leverage_rate: Optional explicit daily financing rate applied to excess leverage while intraday.
        leverage_interest_rate: Annualised interest rate applied to positions carried overnight above ``base_gross_exposure``.
        trading_days_per_year: Trading days used when converting annualised rates to daily equivalents.
        leverage_penalty_annual_rate: Annualised leverage cost used when ``daily_leverage_rate`` is None.
        leverage_penalty_trading_days: Trading days per year used for rate conversion when ``daily_leverage_rate`` is None.
        enforce_end_of_day_cap: If True, positions are automatically scaled back to ``max_gross_leverage`` after each step.
        loss_shutdown_enabled: Enable cooldown gating when recent trades in an asset/direction
            were unprofitable.
        loss_shutdown_cooldown: Number of steps an asset/direction remains in cooldown after a loss.
        loss_shutdown_probe_weight: Maximum weight magnitude allowed while an asset/direction is
            in cooldown. Acts as the "probe trade" size.
        loss_shutdown_penalty: Additional reward penalty applied to allocations that remain in
            cooldown, proportional to absolute weight.
        loss_shutdown_min_position: Minimum absolute weight treated as an active position for the
            shutdown logic to avoid noise from tiny allocations.
        loss_shutdown_return_tolerance: Absolute return threshold below which outcomes are treated
            as neutral (neither profit nor loss) for cooldown updates.
        intraday_leverage_cap: Optional gross exposure cap applied immediately after the action
            projection. If None, defaults to leverage_cap (long/short) or 1.0 (long-only).
        closing_leverage_cap: Optional gross exposure cap enforced at the end of every step before
            carrying positions overnight. If None, defaults to intraday_leverage_cap.
        leverage_interest_rate: Annualised interest rate applied to borrowed exposure above 1x when
            held overnight (after enforcing closing_leverage_cap).
        trading_days_per_year: Number of trading days used to annualise leverage interest.
        regime_filters_enabled: If True, activate the regime guard heuristics that downshift leverage
            and increase turnover penalties in unfavourable windows.
        regime_drawdown_threshold: Drawdown level triggering leverage reduction (None disables).
        regime_leverage_scale: Multiplicative scale applied to allocations when the drawdown guard fires.
        regime_negative_return_window: Trailing window (in steps) used to evaluate cumulative returns.
        regime_negative_return_threshold: Cumulative return threshold; values at or below trigger guards.
        regime_negative_return_turnover_penalty: Turnover penalty applied when the negative-return guard fires.
        regime_turnover_threshold: Turnover level triggering stricter loss-shutdown probe sizing.
        regime_turnover_probe_weight: Loss-shutdown probe weight enforced when the turnover guard fires.
