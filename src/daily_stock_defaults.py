# 2026-04-13: Upgraded to 8-model screened32 ensemble (D_s5→I_s3 swap).
# D_s5 was confirmed drag (pruning test: removing D_s5 improved ensemble by +1.04% med).
# I_s3: tp=0.03 Muon, individual OOS neg=8/100, med=6.64% (I variant, mid trade-penalty)
# 8-model with I_s3 replacing D_s5 (OOS 100 windows, sampled):
#   med=18.17%, p10=+5.07%, neg=8/100, sortino=30.67
# vs previous 8-model (D_s5): med=15.81%, p10=+4.41%, neg=7/100, sortino=27.65
# Key improvements: med+2.36%, sort+3.02, p10+0.66% (neg 7→8, minor cost)
# Exhaustive 263-window eval: pending (running)
# Models: C_s7 (AdamW, tp=0.02) + D_s16, D_s42, D_s3, I_s3, D_s2, D_s14, D_s28
# All models: disable_shorts=True, 65 actions (masked shorts), features_per_sym=16
# Trained on data through 2025-05-31, val 2025-06-01 to 2025-11-30
