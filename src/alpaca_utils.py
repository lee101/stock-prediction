Shared Alpaca-related utilities.

This module centralises leverage and financing rate helpers so that
all trading components apply consistent borrowing costs and leverage
clamps.  The defaults align with the production brokerage setup:

* 6.75% annual borrowing cost.
* 252 trading days per year.
* Baseline 1× gross exposure (unlevered).
* End-of-day leverage target capped at 2× with an intraday ceiling of 4×.
