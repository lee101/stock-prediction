# Comprehensive Stock Prediction Hyperparameter Optimization Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the **complete optimization framework** for stock prediction models, testing three approaches:

1. **Toto** - Probabilistic forecasting with ensemble aggregation
2. **Kronos Standard** - Autoregressive time series forecasting
3. **Kronos Ensemble** - NEW: Kronos with Toto-style aggregation (best of both worlds!)

All optimization is done using **`pct_return_mae`** as the primary metric (not price_mae) since this directly measures trading performance.

## Why This Matters

### The Problem We Solved

Previous hyperparameter selection was optimizing for `price_mae`, but trading performance depends on **percentage returns**, not absolute price predictions. A $1 error on AAPL ($180) is very different from a $1 error on NVDA ($500).

### The Solution

Optimize for `pct_return_mae` and test multiple model architectures:
- Toto excels at robust predictions through ensemble aggregation
- Kronos excels at capturing autoregressive patterns
- Kronos Ensemble combines both strengths

## Model Architectures

### 1. Toto (Baseline)

**How it works:**
- Generates N sample trajectories (64-4096 samples)
- Applies aggregation strategy (trimmed_mean, median, quantile, etc.)
- Robust to outliers through statistical aggregation

**Key hyperparameters:**
- `num_samples`: Number of forecast samples (more = more robust, slower)
- `aggregate`: How to combine samples (trimmed_mean_X removes outliers)
- `samples_per_batch`: Batch size for generation (memory vs speed tradeoff)

**Best configs discovered:**
- High volatility stocks: `trimmed_mean_5` to `trimmed_mean_15` with 128-512 samples
- Low volatility stocks: `mean` or `median` with 2048-4096 samples

### 2. Kronos Standard

**How it works:**
- Autoregressive transformer model
- Direct price prediction with temperature-based sampling
- Single forecast per call (or ensemble of independent samples)

**Key hyperparameters:**
- `temperature`: Controls randomness (0.10-0.30, lower = more conservative)
- `top_p`: Nucleus sampling threshold (0.70-0.90)
- `top_k`: Top-k sampling (0 = disabled, 16-32 for diversity)
- `sample_count`: Number of independent samples to generate
- `max_context`: Historical window (192-256)
- `clip`: Value clipping for stability (1.2-2.5)

**When it works best:**
- Low volatility stocks (SPY, QQQ)
- Strongly trending markets
- When you need fast predictions

### 3. Kronos Ensemble (NOVEL APPROACH)

**How it works:**
- Generates multiple Kronos predictions with **different temperatures**
- Applies Toto-style aggregation (trimmed_mean, median, etc.)
- Combines Kronos's autoregressive strength with Toto's robustness

**Key hyperparameters:**
- `temperature`: Base temperature
- `temperature_range`: Temperature variation (e.g., 0.10 to 0.25)
- `num_samples`: Number of temperature-varied predictions (5-15)
- `aggregate`: Aggregation method (trimmed_mean_X)
- All other Kronos params (top_p, top_k, max_context, clip)

**Results:**
- Better than Kronos Standard in most cases
- Sometimes competitive with Toto
- Good middle ground: faster than Toto, more robust than Kronos

## Optimization Framework

### Tools Created

#### 1. `optimize_all_models.py` - Single Stock Comprehensive Optimization

Runs Optuna-based optimization for all three model types on one stock.

```bash
# Optimize AAPL with 30 trials per model
python optimize_all_models.py --symbol AAPL --trials 30

# Results saved to:
# - hyperparams_optimized_all/toto/AAPL.json
# - hyperparams_optimized_all/kronos_standard/AAPL.json
# - hyperparams_optimized_all/kronos_ensemble/AAPL.json
```

#### 2. `run_full_optimization.py` - Parallel Batch Optimization

Runs optimization across multiple stocks in parallel with progress tracking.

```bash
# Optimize 3 stocks in parallel with 20 trials each
python run_full_optimization.py --symbols AAPL NVDA SPY --trials 20 --workers 2

# Optimize ALL stocks with 30 trials, 3 parallel workers
python run_full_optimization.py --trials 30 --workers 3 --save-summary results.json

# See live progress with Rich UI
```

#### 3. `run_full_optimization.sh` - Shell Script Wrapper

Simple shell script for batch optimization.

```bash
# Default: 30 trials, 3 workers, all stocks
./run_full_optimization.sh

# Custom configuration
./run_full_optimization.sh --trials 50 --workers 4 --symbols "AAPL NVDA TSLA"
```

### Hyperparameter Search Strategy

We use **Optuna with TPE (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator) sampler**:
- Bayesian optimization approach
- Learns from previous trials to focus on promising regions
- Much more efficient than grid search
- Handles mixed types (categorical, continuous, integer)

**Search Spaces:**

**Toto:**
- num_samples: [64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048]
- aggregate: [trimmed_mean_5/10/15/20, lower_trimmed_mean_10/15/20, quantile_0.15/0.20/0.25, mean, median]
- samples_per_batch: Adaptive based on num_samples

**Kronos Standard:**
- temperature: 0.10 to 0.30 (continuous)
- top_p: 0.70 to 0.90 (continuous)
- top_k: [0, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32]
- sample_count: [128, 160, 192, 224, 256]
- max_context: [192, 224, 256]
- clip: 1.2 to 2.5 (continuous)

**Kronos Ensemble:**
- temperature: 0.10 to 0.25 (continuous, base temp)
- temp_max: 0.20 to 0.35 (continuous, max temp in range)
- top_p: 0.75 to 0.90 (continuous)
- top_k: [0, 16, 24, 32]
- num_samples: [5, 8, 10, 12, 15] (fewer than Toto, but with temp variation)
- max_context: [192, 224, 256]
- clip: 1.4 to 2.2 (continuous)
- aggregate: [trimmed_mean_5/10/15/20, median, mean]

## Running Full Optimization

### Quick Start

```bash
# Test on 3 stocks first
python run_full_optimization.py --symbols AAPL NVDA SPY --trials 20 --workers 2

# Once validated, run on all stocks
python run_full_optimization.py --trials 30 --workers 3 --save-summary full_optimization_results.json
```

### Expected Runtime

Per stock (20 trials per model = 60 total evaluations):
- Fast stocks (low volatility, small context): 5-7 minutes
- Average stocks: 8-12 minutes
- Slow stocks (crypto, high volatility, large sample counts): 15-20 minutes

**Total for 24 stocks:**
- Sequential: ~6-8 hours
- With 3 parallel workers: ~2-3 hours
- With 4 parallel workers: ~1.5-2.5 hours

### Resource Requirements

**Memory:**
- Peak: ~8-12 GB per worker (with GPU)
- Safe with 32GB RAM total for 3 workers

**GPU:**
- Highly recommended (20x faster than CPU)
- Can run on CPU but expect 30-60 min per stock
- Multiple GPUs: Set different workers to different devices

**Disk:**
- Results: ~100KB per stock
- Logs: ~1-5MB per stock
- Total: <500MB for all stocks

## Analyzing Results

### Results Directory Structure

```
hyperparams_optimized_all/
├── toto/
│   ├── AAPL.json
│   ├── NVDA.json
│   └── ...
├── kronos_standard/
│   ├── AAPL.json
│   └── ...
└── kronos_ensemble/
    ├── AAPL.json
    └── ...
```

### Result File Format

Each JSON file contains:

```json
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "model_type": "toto",
  "config": {
    "num_samples": 128,
    "aggregate": "trimmed_mean_15",
    "samples_per_batch": 32
  },
  "validation": {
    "price_mae": 1.89,
    "pct_return_mae": 0.015207,  // PRIMARY METRIC
    "latency_s": 2.33
  }
}
```

### Finding Best Model Per Stock

The parallel runner automatically identifies the best model:

```bash
# Check summary
cat optimization_summary.json | jq '.results[] | {symbol, best_model, best_mae}'
```

### Comparing Models

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

# Load all results
for symbol in ["AAPL", "NVDA", "SPY"]:
    results = {}
    for model in ["toto", "kronos_standard", "kronos_ensemble"]:
        path = Path(f"hyperparams_optimized_all/{model}/{symbol}.json")
        if path.exists():
            with open(path) as f:
                data = json.load(f)
                results[model] = data["validation"]["pct_return_mae"]

    best = min(results, key=results.get)
    print(f"{symbol}: {best} = {results[best]:.6f}")
```

## Updating Production Configs

Once optimization is complete, update production configs:

```python
# Create update script
python update_from_optimized.py --source hyperparams_optimized_all --target hyperparams/best
```

Or manually for specific stocks:

```bash
# Example: Update AAPL with toto config
cp hyperparams_optimized_all/toto/AAPL.json hyperparams/best/AAPL.json
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Per-Stock Deep Dive

For critical stocks, run extended optimization:

```bash
# 100 trials per model for AAPL
python optimize_all_models.py --symbol AAPL --trials 100
```

### 2. Time-Based Validation

Split data by time periods:

```python
# Validate on recent data (last 3 months)
# Train optimization on older data
# This tests temporal stability
```

### 3. Ensemble of Ensembles

Combine best Toto and Kronos Ensemble:

```python
# Weight by inverse MAE
weight_toto = mae_kronos / (mae_toto + mae_kronos)
weight_kronos = mae_toto / (mae_toto + mae_kronos)
final_prediction = weight_toto * toto_pred + weight_kronos * kronos_pred
```

### 4. Market Regime Detection

Switch models based on volatility:

```python
if recent_volatility > threshold:
    use toto with trimmed_mean_5  # Conservative
else:
    use kronos_ensemble  # Faster, good enough for low vol
```

## Troubleshooting

### Optimization Too Slow

- Reduce trials (20 instead of 30)
- Increase workers (if you have GPU/RAM)
- Filter to top priority stocks only
- Use CPU for low-priority stocks in parallel

### Out of Memory

- Reduce workers (3 → 2 or 2 → 1)
- Reduce sample counts in search space
- Use smaller max_context values

### Poor Results on Specific Stock

- Check data quality (missing values, outliers)
- Try manual config tuning
- Consider stock characteristics (crypto vs equity)
- Run extended optimization (100+ trials)

### Model Taking Too Long in Production

- Use Kronos Standard or Ensemble instead of Toto
- Reduce num_samples for Toto
- Cache predictions
- Use smaller max_context

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run full optimization on all stocks
2. Analyze model selection patterns (which model wins where?)
3. Implement automatic config updates
4. Backtest with new configs
5. Deploy to production with A/B testing
6. Set up continuous re-optimization (monthly?)
