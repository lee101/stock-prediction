# HF Training System Improvements & Testing Report

**Generated:** 2025-08-24

## Executive Summary

‚úÖ **SUCCESS:** We have successfully improved the HuggingFace-style training system, added comprehensive unit tests, and validated all improvements through working experiments on small data.

## Key Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. Learning Rate Getting Stuck at Zero (CRITICAL FIX)

**Problem:** Learning rate scheduler was getting stuck at 0.00 after warmup, preventing effective training.

**Solution:** 
- Implemented `CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts` scheduler with minimum LR
- Added improved scheduler library with multiple strategies
- Fixed the issue where LR would decay to zero and stay there

**Result:** Learning rate now properly cycles and maintains training momentum throughout the process.

### 2. Batch Size Mismatch in Action Labels

**Problem:** Tensor shape mismatches causing training crashes during evaluation.

**Solution:** 
- Fixed action label tensor creation in `StockDataset`
- Removed unnecessary `.squeeze()` calls that were causing shape issues
- Ensured consistent tensor shapes throughout the pipeline

**Result:** Training now runs smoothly without tensor shape errors.

### 3. Model Saving/Loading Issues

**Problem:** PyTorch's new security restrictions were preventing model loading.

**Solution:** 
- Updated model loading to use `weights_only=False` for configuration objects
- Implemented proper checkpoint structure with model state, config, and metadata
- Added comprehensive save/load functionality with validation

**Result:** Models can now be saved and loaded reliably with all necessary components.

## New Features & Improvements

### 1. Comprehensive Unit Test Suite

**Created test files:**
- `tests/experimental/hf/test_hftraining_data_utils.py` - Data processing and utilities
- `tests/experimental/hf/test_hftraining_model.py` - Model architecture and components  
- `tests/experimental/hf/test_hftraining_training.py` - Training pipeline and trainer
- `tests/experimental/training/test_modern_optimizers.py` - Modern optimizer implementations

**Coverage:**
- StockDataProcessor functionality
- Model initialization and forward passes
- Training loop components
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Optimizer behavior validation
- Configuration management

### 2. Small Dataset Testing Environment

**Features:**
- Synthetic data generation with realistic stock patterns
- Quick test runner for rapid validation
- Configurable model sizes for testing
- Automated experiment tracking

**Implementation:** `quick_test_runner.py`

### 3. Improved Scheduler Library

**New schedulers:**
- `CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts` - Prevents LR getting stuck
- `ImprovedLinearWarmupCosineDecay` - Better warmup handling
- `CyclicalLR` - Cyclical learning rates for better convergence
- Automatic scheduler selection based on training parameters

### 4. Enhanced Configuration System

**Improvements:**
- Modular configuration with separate sections (model, training, data, etc.)
- Predefined configurations for different scenarios (quick_test, production, research)
- JSON serialization with proper dataclass handling
- Configuration validation and error handling

### 5. Better Logging and Metrics

**Features:**
- Colored console output for better readability
- Comprehensive training metrics tracking
- TensorBoard integration
- Detailed experiment reports generation
- Best model tracking with automatic saving

### 6. NanoChat-Inspired Acceleration (2025-10-16)

**Motivation:** Borrow fast-training tricks from the `nanochat/` LLM pipeline to speed up time-series training.

**Key Enhancements:**
- Runtime bootstrap now defaults to `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` and high-precision matmuls, mirroring `nanochat.common.compute_init`.
- Added a `muon` optimizer option that applies Muon orthogonalized updates to matrix weights and AdamW-style updates to biases, bringing Keller et al.'s optimizer to the forecasting stack.
- Logging now records GPU-synchronized step times and derived tokens-per-second metrics (sequence length √ó samples/sec) for easier throughput tuning.

**Usage Notes:**
- Set `training.optimizer = "muon"` (or CLI `--optimizer muon`) to enable the new optimizer; optional hyper-parameters `muon_momentum`, `muon_ns_steps`, etc., are exposed in the config dataclasses.
- `run_training.py` automatically configures the CUDA allocator and TF32/bfloat16-friendly matmul precision‚Äîno manual flags required.
- TensorBoard and perf CSV outputs include `train/tokens_per_sec`, making it straightforward to compare against LLM training MFU targets.
